# this is notebook for car price prediction in that

1)data preprocessing

ðŸ§  Model Building

Used RandomForestRegressor (non-linear model)

Identified feature importance using ExtraTreesRegressor

Data split: 80% training / 20% testing

Why Random Forest?

Handles non-linear relationships and complex feature interactions

Robust to outliers

Automatically captures feature importance

ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Metrics

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

RÂ² Score

ðŸš€ Suggestions for Future Improvements

Perform hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV

Evaluate additional models (e.g., XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression)

Implement a model pipeline for easier deployment

Consider cross-validation for more reliable evaluation
